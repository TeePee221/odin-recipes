    <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
    <p>Macaroni and cheese—also called mac and cheese in the United States and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom[1]—is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar. It can also incorporate other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs or meat.[2][3]

        Traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix.[3] The cheese is often first incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food.[4][5]</p>
